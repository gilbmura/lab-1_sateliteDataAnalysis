## Overview

This project provides tools to analyze satellite temperature and humidity data using Linux commands. The analysis involves extracting the top 10 highest temperatures and filtering the data by country and sorting by humidity.

## Task 1: Clean the Repository

Before starting the analysis, some cleanup of the repository was required. We followed these steps to clean and organize the repository:

1. **Rename the directory `rename_directory` to `analyzed_data`**:
   Rename the directory that holds the analysis results to `analyzed_data`:
2. **We deleted dummy files from the repo
3. **We made sure we remained with two directories: raw_data and analyzed_data.
   - In raw_data this is where our scripts and the file where our insights will be extracted from is stored.
   - In analyzed_data is where our files will be stored after being extracted by the scripts
#**Note
More information about all process is stored in the README files of the individual directories.
